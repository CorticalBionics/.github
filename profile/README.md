# Cortical Bionics Research Group

The mission of the [Cortical Bionics Research Group](https://www.corticalbionics.com/) is to build next-generation intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces that enable dexterous control of bionic hands by people with paralysis or amputation. We harness existing control signals from motor cortex and restore lost sensory feedback via microstimulation of somatosensory cortex. Our foundational principle is that a dexterous bionic hand can only be achieved by developing bionic control schemes that are informed by the brainâ€™s natural ones. 

The Cortical Bionics Research Group consists of members from the University of Pittsburgh, University of Chicago, and Northwestern University.
